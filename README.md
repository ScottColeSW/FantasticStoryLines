 I post my stories here. I have developed several works of fiction, games, and simple tools to make a task easier

 # About The Land by Dr. Aleron Kong
 This is a fantasitc series. It is a new-ish genre and he does it best imho. 

 The reason I am writing this segment, unbidden, is because the last book, Book 8: Monsters, left us in a lurch... the cliffhanger is over 2 years old now and it keeps bothering me.

 This is a good way to get these thoughts out. Who knows... someone may like it and/or contribute.
